# slaash

`slaash` is a simple on-premise serverless-as-a-service platform.

It allows you to deploy your git-hosted functions and applications in a few seconds.

The platform is mostly built using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Istio](https://istio.io/),
[Knative](https://knative.dev/) and [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/).

It features a web user interface as well as an easy to use REST API.
